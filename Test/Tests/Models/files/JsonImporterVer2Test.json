Although my ~\/.vimrc is less than just 3000 lines, there are plenty of good tricks worth telling to you. I'd like to tell you about my Vim knowledge, and learn how you yourself are optimizing Vim.\n\nI'd like to make the event in English, because most Japanese have already been learning English for a while. Of course, attendees are supposed to be familiar with Ruby and Vim, because they are the lingua franca of this event. I can help translating Japanese to English or English to Japanese. Even if you don't have a lot of confidence with other languages, you can still attend this event.\n\nOther editor users such as Emacs users also can attend this event.
