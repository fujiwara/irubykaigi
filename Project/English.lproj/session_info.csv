17H04	2010-08-27	16:40 - 17:40	From Rails to Rack: Making Rails 3 a Better Ruby Citizen	Yehuda Katz (Engine Yard)		Hitotsubashi Memorial Hall	2nd Floor		Rails 3 is on its way, and Yehuda Katz is giving attendees a sneak peek! With the advent of the Rack spec and library, Ruby web frameworks can interact in unprecedented ways. Imagine a Rails application routing to a Sinatra application, or Merb-style exception pages that catch exceptions from Rails or Cloudkit. These are focal points of Rails 3 and Yehuda's talk.  The idea is simple: create a tiny API for interaction between elements of a web application. Instead of requiring special mechanisms for tests, controller instantiation, or CSRF forgery protection, design apps as a collection of such elements strung together into a stack. As with Unix pipes, limiting the interaction between elements makes powerful combinations a snap.  In addition to Rack, Rails 3 will have better support for other Ruby packages, leveraging the work Merb did to support app-specific bundles. It will limit the changes it needs to make to the global namespaces, making it easier to use Rails together with other Ruby code without fearing that the changes that Rails will conflict with the other code. Finally, components of Rails 3 will be available, in an unprecedented way, as libraries that can be used outside of the web framework context to perform different kinds of work. For instance,  ActiveSupport will finally be modular enough to use easily in a third-party library, and ActionController and ActionView will be decoupled enough from the request/response context to be usable for other templating purposes.  Join Yehuda and talk about how the powerful ideas of Rack and modularity are informing Rails 3, and how they will change the way you develop.	Yehuda Katz is currently employed by Engine Yard, and works full time as a Core Team Member on the Rails and Merb projects. He is the co-author of jQuery in Action and the upcoming Rails 3 in Action, and is a contributor to Ruby in Practice. He spends most of his time hacking on Rails and Merb, but also on other Ruby community projects, like Rubinius and Datamapper. And when the solution doesn't yet exist, he'll try his hand at creating one - as such, he's also created projects like Thor and DO.rb.

But dynamic typing has disadvantages, the processing time is long and the program has lower reliability. Because type checking is executed at runtime. But static typing has advantages, processing time is fast and the program has high reliability. Because type checking is executed before runtime. Therefore we design and implement a programming language with static typing like Ruby. And we implement type inference because of keeping Ruby’s advantage.	(TBA)

Conference Room	2nd Floor		Sinatra has been getting a lot of hype lately as the next great (micro)-framework. In writing apps, diving in, and contributing the reasons for its existence have become more clear. Sinatra is not just a toy or a neat trick, it's the best way to create simple and non-obtrusive web interfaces to sit on top of a new or existing ruby codebase. Sinatra is not a framework - Its a library. My conceit is that Sinatra's greatest achievement will be empowering other ruby projects the ability to 'speak web' and communicate to users and developers through the browser. I'll walk through the basics of Sinatra and give a number of examples of how to make quick use of Sinatra to give your project a light but powerful interface.	Aaron Quint is a web developer based in Brooklyn, NY. Working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails he's launched over 25 different web applications in the last 2 years.

Programming with irb is an interactive process, expected to provide immediate feedback from the Ruby interpreter, typically warnings and error messages that show inconsistencies or programming mistakes, when code is executed. However, a program fragment can be executed only when all dependent fragments are also written.  This may introduce a potentially substantial delay between programming and validation, filled with distractions from writing the needed dependent code.  As a result, error messages are emitted later than necessary, and may appear in other blocks of code than where the error originates.  Essentially, irb lacks a type checker:a system to infer types and check their consistency before code is executed. This is not surprising, given the obstacles that irb’s interactive code development raises for type checking.  As one develops a program, code fragments are written and re-written; each are difficult to validate in isolation, and complex to merge and re-check collectively.  We have implemented a system that reports type errors for incomplete irb programs, by verifying code blocks as they are developed, and checking that they mesh correctly with other code blocks as the developer changes and replaces them.  By using principal typings inference, our tool adds lightweight type checking to the Ruby language without changing the syntax.  As a result, coders will be able to reduce development time by more precisely locating errors at a better time in the development process.	Andriy Hnativ is a M.Sc. student studying programming languages at the University of Saskatchewan under the direction of Prof. Chris Dutchyn.  Among other things, he is interested in functional programming languages, open-source development, and dynamic languages, especially Ruby and Python.
19H03	2010-08-29	09:30 - 12:00	To the Edge of Web Performance and Beyond	Joshua Hull (AideRSS)		Hitotsubashi Memorial Hall	2nd Floor		File caching, Memcache, Squid, Varnish and ESI have become common tools in arsenal of those pushing their application to millions of users a day. However, these strategies have not been without their drawbacks. Cache invalidation, and immature implementations within Ruby have hampered the support of these in the real world. Examining the current crop of tools and their limitations can shed light on both the problems and the solutions.  Whether you're serving a relatively small website or are managing a whole farm of servers, quick responses can make the difference between joy and user frustration.  This talk will discuss: "Current caching strategies and their strengths and weaknesses",  "Invalidation performance and the "dog-pile" effect" and "Real live working code - Plenty of benchmarks".  We will take a sample application through these various caching strategies, paying attention to ease of implementation and performance along the way. By employing EventMachine, Tokyo Cabinet, Tokyo Dystopia, Rack and some sweet syntactic sugar, we will find the easy, golden path for web performance.	Joshua is a Ruby developer at PostRank, a social engagement monitoring and analytics platform. Lately, he has been focusing on the performance of both Ruby and Rails and looking at how to improve the whole web stack. You can find what his brain is thinking about next at github (github.com/joshbuddy) and twitter (@joshbuddy).

The current socket library is easy for frequent tasks but it is uselessly difficult for rare tasks.

Another example is that binary string is used for socket option, etc. which causes program more difficult than C.
